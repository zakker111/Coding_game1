# Versions

This project follows **Semantic Versioning** (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR**: breaking changes to bot APIs, replay formats, save formats, or public interfaces.
- **MINOR**: new features that are backwards-compatible.
- **PATCH**: bug fixes and small improvements.

## Release discipline (required)

- Every deployable build (client and/or server) must have a **version string**.
  - The deployed version should be visible somewhere (UI footer/about panel) and logged on startup.
- Every merge that changes user-visible behavior or spec contracts must update `Versions.md`.
- **Bump the version before merging** (no “we’ll do it later”).
- Every release entry must include a **timestamp**.
  - Format: ISO 8601 in UTC (example: `2026-03-02T12:34:56Z`).

## Unreleased

### Added
- Selftest improvements (coverage + diagnostics) for Workshop/engine integration.

### Changed
- Engine/replay contract: `schemaVersion` bumped to `0.2.0` (and docs/plans aligned to `rulesetVersion = 0.2.0`).
- Deploy Workshop build tag bumped to **v0.3.3** (schemaVersion bump to 0.2.0 + example script updates).
- Example bot scripts now include locked loadout header directives as the first 3 non-blank lines:
  - `;@slot1 <MODULE|EMPTY>`
  - `;@slot2 <MODULE|EMPTY>`
  - `;@slot3 <MODULE|EMPTY>`
  These are UI/UX metadata comments; authoritative loadout is still the match config / structured UI state.

### Updated
- Spec clarifications for `rulesetVersion = 0.2.0` loadouts:
  - explicit per-bot 3-slot loadouts (default-empty if omitted + deterministic normalization + `loadoutIssues`)
  - invalid loadouts surface as **visible, non-blocking warnings/errors** via `loadoutIssues` (match still runs)
- `ARMOR` semantics: passive mitigation (~33%) + speed penalty + SHIELD→ARMOR ordering.

### Fixed
- `packages/engine`: fixed VM init corruption in `initBotVm` (could break execution).
- `TARGET_CLOSEST_BULLET` tie-break now uses numeric bullet creation order (`B1 < B2 < …`, not lexicographic).
- `packages/replay` sample generator no longer source-scans for module capability; it is loadout-driven (consistent with `rulesetVersion = 0.2.0`).
- Sample replay starter bot source includes the same `;@slot*` header directives for consistency.
- Phase 6: golden determinism fixtures committed + enforced in CI.

### Deferred
- Workshop UX polish: make `loadoutIssues` more prominent (still non-blocking).
- Phase 4+ correctness work: tighten invariants (no NaNs/out-of-bounds) and harden bullet collision edge cases.

## 0.0.3 — 2026-03-17T00:00:00Z

> Marketing version: **0.03** (SemVer: `0.0.3`).

### Added
- Deploy Workshop (buildless static):
  - Visible build tag chip in header (`WORKSHOP_BUILD`), **v0.3.1**.
  - Inspector improvements:
    - bot display names shown in Inspector + event formatting
    - tick events grouped (Movement/Combat/Resources/Other) with collapsible headers
    - tick events modes: **All** toggle + **Raw** toggle
    - tick events filter/search + match count status
    - raw tick events JSON includes `nameMap` and `eventsWithNames` (and includes query metadata when filtered)
- Deploy drift guardrails:
  - `pnpm sync:deploy`, `pnpm check:deploy`
  - `pnpm check:deploy:imports` validates deploy-time JS import targets
- Workshop QA smoke:
  - `scripts/qa-workshop.mjs` supports local serve (`--serve`) and multi-URL checks.
  - Covers run/preview + opponent selection/randomize + tick-events All/Raw/Filter + raw JSON shape.

### Fixed
- Deploy Workshop now ensures `/workshop` resolves to `/workshop/` to avoid broken relative module imports.
- Deploy Workshop engine worker boundary: improved failure reporting and rejects in-flight runs on worker errors.

### Changed
- Bumped workspace package versions to `0.0.3` (`apps/web`, `packages/engine`, `packages/replay`, root, and legacy `site`).

---

## 0.0.2 — 2026-03-07T00:00:00Z

> Marketing version: **0.02** (SemVer: `0.0.2`).

### Added
- Monorepo workspace:
  - `apps/web` (Nowt web app)
  - `packages/engine` (bot DSL compiler/VM + deterministic simulation + replay generation)
  - `packages/replay` (legacy replay generator + typings; not used by the Workshop)
  - `deploy/` (buildless static workshop prototype)
- Deterministic simulation + replay generation (engine-driven) including:
  - stable PRNG (no `Math.random()`)
  - continuous positions in a 192×192 arena
  - bots spawning in the four corners
  - bullets + bot/bot + bot/wall collisions
  - powerups (spawn/pickup/despawn) represented in replay state and rendered in the arena
  - SAW melee demo behavior for SAW-capable bots
- Client Workshop features (local, deterministic):
  - landing (`/`) → workshop (`/workshop`)
  - bot editing for `BOT1..BOT4` with local persistence and an explicit apply/update flow for BOT1
  - deterministic opponent selection/randomization (seeded; no `Math.random()`)
  - replay controls (play/pause, step, scrub) with smooth intra-tick interpolation
  - arena rendering: grid + walls + bots + bullets + powerups
  - inspector: per-bot stats + filtered tick event log (including bumps and powerups)
- Vite global `__APP_VERSION__` injected from `apps/web/package.json` and shown in UI.
- Tests:
  - determinism tests for replay generation
  - unit tests for opponent selection and arena utilities

### Changed
- Root `pnpm` scripts target `apps/web` for `dev/build/test`.
- Workspace configuration (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) includes `apps/*` and `packages/*`, excluding legacy `site/`.

### Notes
- `packages/engine` is the authoritative simulation core for `rulesetVersion = 0.2.0` (replay `schemaVersion = 0.2.0`).
- `packages/replay` remains a legacy/sample generator and should not be treated as authoritative.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-03-01T00:00:00Z

> Marketing version: **0.01** (SemVer: `0.0.1`).

### Added
- Initial repository created (spec-first Markdown + planning docs).
